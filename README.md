# ThinkIQ Azure IoT Project #

## WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? ##

There is currently a divergence between IoT suppliers while the users are looking for convergence and interoperability. While Azure IoT Central is delivering capabilities that are attractive to a wide set of users, it is unlikely to reach the same Smart Manufacturing depth delivered by SMIP. 

## WHAT IS THE PROJECT OBJECTIVE:  ##

- Manage connectivity to Azure IoT Central
- Read and write Device Templates.
- Read and write Devices.
- Read and write Continuous Data.

## TECHNICAL APPROACH: ##

The functionality will be implemented by connecting SMIP to Azure IoT through the Azure IoT Central API.
The SMIP Information Model Editor and Model Storage will be enhanced to configure integration with Azure IoT Central.
Azure IoT Devices integrated with SMIP will get access to all the relevant services offered by SMIP such as the SMIP Historian and the scripting



## Development Tools and Environment ##

This project is written in C# using Visual Studio 2019, .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET Core 3.1. It also requires access to Azure IoT Central.
